                When there is surf, we Surf. But we also love a good cup of coffee and hanging out together.
                Every second week we have a Bible study. Then we come together on a Sunday afternoon or evening 
                to read, pray and listen what God has to tell us.

            <h2>CSALT</h2>
            <p>
               To train and equip the younger generation. To eventually send them off ready to take on the world as a disciple of Jesus.
               During this progam you learn about yourself, about God, about the surfing world and about what you stand for.
               To get to know more about this progam, don't hesitate to fill in the <a href="contact.html"><strong>contact form</strong></a>. We will come back to you shortly. 
               Or take a look on our CSALT website <a href="https://www.csalt.co.za/program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>.

            <h2>International Conference</h2>
            <p>Every two years we organise an international conference. And every time it is on a different continent.
                And even in a different country. Christian Surfers is active in 33 countries at this moment. So no conference is the same.
                When we come together, we go camping, hiking, surfing the best waves we can find. We have fun, we share life and all the
                stories that come with us. Most important of all is that we connect with people from all over the world and worship our God together.

            <h2>Serving</h2>
            <p>This one can be challenging. Serving whenever and wherever needed. Filling in a position during a surfing competition
                behind the scenes. Sometimes that means picking up trash or cleaning up someone else stuff. Other times it means being 
                a beach marshal on the side and meeting all the world champions during the surfing tour. Whatever is might be, we always
                try to serve with a thankful smile on our face.
