# Christian Surfers Skiffa

This project is created to help surfers get in contact with the local surf community in Scheveningen ( skiffa in short slang language ).
My goal is to make it easier for users to find Christian Surfers on the internet, knowing that there is a need for. There is only an international website which makes it hard to reach this specific local surfing community. While I know a lot of surfers who are trying to connect with others and are still struggling finding a way. 

As Christian Surfers we want to live life together. Having fun, enjoying coffee's, surfing pumping waves and share our main believe in Jesus above all.

## Features Left To Implement
* In the future I would like to add a webshop to this website where I could sell items like t-shirts, caps, Bibles and more to support the movement of Christian Surfers. 
* Another feature would be an synchronised agenda where the user can see when and where we meet.
