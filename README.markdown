# Christian Surfers Skiffa

This project is created to help surfers get in contact with the local surf community in Scheveningen ( skiffa in short slang language ).
My goal is to make it easier to be found on the internet as we did not have a website before. Internationaly we have a website but not locally, which made it hard to reach this specific surfing community. While I know a lot of surfers who are trying to connect with others and are still struggling finding a way. 

As Christian Surfers we want to live life together. Having fun, enjoying coffee's, surfing pumping waves and share our main believe in Jesus above all.
